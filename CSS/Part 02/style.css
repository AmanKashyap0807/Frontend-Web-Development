/* Universal selection (*) */
* {

/* Element selector */
h1 {
    color: #B92B27;

/* we can apply element selector for more than one at a time  by seperating each with comma*/
h1,
h3 {
    font-size: 20px;
}

/* ID selector */
#signup,
#login {
    background-color: #B92B27;

/*sometimes we need to select a group of elements so that time we group them with same class names */
/* Class selector */
/* .follow {
    color: blue;
} */

/* Descendant selector */
/* the inner element are knows as descendants for the outer element */
/*for this we first write the name of outer element then inner element to whcih we have to apply */
/* let suppose i have to change color of all anchor tag under paragram block */
/* p a {
    color: aqua;
    background-color: yellowgreen;
} */

/* this above is a method to style element under element but it will do it for all anchor under para which is not good*/
/* so we will use element under class tag */
.para a {
    color: black;
    background-color: aliceblue;
}

/* we can also go for 3 level descendants select */
nav ul li {
    color: blueviolet;
    /* background-color: beige; */
}

/* we can also go for further 4 5 6 level descendants select */
/* we can also write direct outer most and inner most element name to style element */

/* Sibling combinator */
/* used to style any element on the same level of another element */
/* like in our html code there is immidiate h3 after every paragraph */
p+h3 {
    text-decoration: black underline;
}

/* we can use it with different cutomization as did in descendant selectors */
.upvote-arrow+button {
    color: greenyellow;
    background-color: teal;
}

/* Child combinator */
/* used to style immidiate chile element of a element */
/* for example in my html code there is div and input whcih are on child parent relation */
div>input {
    /* color: green; */
    background-color: darkgray;
}

/* remember it must be a immidiate child */

/* attribute selectors */
/* selecting any element on the basis of attibute value provided to it */
input[type="text"] {
    color: blue;
}

/* this will show difference while giving input */
/* only attribute can be passed to select */

/* Pseudo class : to perform a change of style for a perticular action */
/* hover effect : cursor position going to an element */
button:hover {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
}

/* active : effect after clicking */
/* checked : effect after checking a box or radio button */
input[type="radio"]:active+label {
    color: #B92B27;
    font-weight: bold;
}

/* nth-of-type() : to apply the effect on the nth element which will be passed on open bracket */
/* calculation of nth element will be based on simplings */

/* pseudo element : used to show chnage in style in a perticular part of an element like first letter of a line or first line
of the paragram */

/* First letter : used to style in the first letter of the element */
h1::first-letter {
    color: green;
}

/* First line : used to style in the first line of the element */

/* selection : used to style in the selected part of the element like lighting of para line when selected */
h3::selection {

    background-color: black;
}

/* we have learnt stylesheet part but what is meaning of cascading */
/* cascading meand the rules to apply the style on a css file */
/* for example if we apply same style on a same element then the last one will be selected as final */
h1 {
    color: blue;
}

h1 {
    color: blueviolet;
}

/* Quora uora will be chnages to blueviolet bacause that was the last one to be styled */
/* in case if two css file linked to a html file then the last one linked will be executed finally in case of similar element 
similar styling */

/* selector specificity : in case if we are applying same style on same element with different selector 
then the priority order of the execution will be : id > class attribute or pseudo class > element or pseudo element
means among 3 if there is id then it will be finalised style other class otherwise element */

/* by hover the cursor on the css selector we can see its specificity, it will be something like _,_,_ and amongh these three we 
will get like first fill will be for id, second will be for class and third will be for element */

/* if there is tie up with the specificity then we will loop for cascading order */

/* inline style has more priority then id */
